Simulation of the flocking behaviors of birds in unity

using the flocking algorithm, which it's based on three simple rules:

Separation

Avoid crowding neighbors.

Alignment

Steer towards the average heading of neighbors.

Cohesion

Steer towards the average position of neighbors.

if you are interested in how exactly the algorithm works, you can read more about it on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)
